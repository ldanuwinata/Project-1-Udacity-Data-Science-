### Installation
This project uses the libraries provided by Anaconda (Python 3.7.4), e.g. pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.

### Project Motivation
The goal of the project is to observe the happiness in different regions in the world and investigate what factors have the strong influence towards the happiness. The workflow of the project follows the 
CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining). Thus the following research questions are first defined:
   1. Which region is the happiest region in the world?
   2. Does the economy effects happiness significantly? 
   3. What factor influence the happiness the most?

### File Description
The project includes three files in the repository:
   - README.md: this file gives the overview of the project
   - Project1_Script.ipynb: this file includes the python code used in the project
   - World_Happiness_Report_2015.csv: this file is the dataset used in the project
   
### Data Understanding
- Dataset is sourced from World Happiness Report https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

   - Country - Name of the country.
   - Region - Region the country belongs to.
   - Happiness Rank - Rank of country based on the Happiness Score

   scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest."
   - Economy (GDP per Capita) - The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score.

### How to Interact With the Project
The data is manipulated and anlysed using the jupyter notebook (Project1_Script.ipynb). All code works fine.
